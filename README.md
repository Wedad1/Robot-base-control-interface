# Robot-base-control-interface
In this task I added the html code for the base control 
interface to the html code for the arm control interface so that all the required contents on the two interfaces appear on one page, and I added the base control interfaceâ€™s css code to The css code for the arm control interface in order to control the entire page formats after merging, and I added the php code for the base control interface to the php code for the arm control interface to link it to the database and send the values of all contents to the database and retrieve the required values,the base control interface contains five buttons, one to stop and four to move the base in directions. When you click on one of the buttons, the value goes to the database. To know the last movement process, I created a php page to connect the database to the hardware to retrieve the last direction of movement. The php page appears after clicking on one of the buttons.
in the sixth task (Convert the interface or display it as a mobile web view) I implemented it by adding a special format code in the css file that requires a specific screen size to show the appropriate format to display the page as a mobile web view page
